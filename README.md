# MIS413-R-finalproj
Using R on a dataset of 3000 individuals who secured a personal loan from a national lender in the United States to identify the factors that lead to loan default and to recommend data mining algorithms that can predict whether a customer will default on their loan.

1. Create 8 relevant questions for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that explore the relationship between loan defaults and other variables given in the data set. Provide data summaries by giving data frames (using dplyr), plots (using ggplot2), or both.
2. Explore which variables are important for predictions (Variable Importance and Selection) and include a short analysis of results and justifications for final variables chosen.
3. Use 3 classification algorithms for Predictive Modeling and analyze the results from each model.
4. Write a summary of overall findings and recommendations.
